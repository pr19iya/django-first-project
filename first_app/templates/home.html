					<h4>My First Project  as an intern</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>As an intern at Techsonix, my first project involved developing a personal portfolio web application. 
                        The goal of the project was to create a responsive and visually appealing platform to showcase my skills, projects, and background. 
                        I used technologies like HTML, CSS, Django, and Bootstrap to build the front-end. 
                    </p>
                    <p> This project helped me understand the importance of clean UI/UX design, component-based development, and responsive layouts. 
                        I also learned how to deploy a website and manage version control using Git and GitHub. 
                        This experience greatly boosted my confidence and gave me a strong foundation to build more complex web applications in the future.</p>

					<h5>My Experience after completing first project</h5>
					<hr>
					
					<p>Working on my first project at Techsonix was a truly enriching experience. It gave me the opportunity to step into a professional environment and apply my technical knowledge in a practical setting. At first, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the expectations and the pace of the work, but with the support of my team and some self-learning, I gradually gained confidence. I learned to work with new tools and frameworks that were previously unfamiliar to me, and I also improved my skills in collaboration and time management. One of the biggest takeaways was understanding how real-world development differs from academic work, especially in terms of debugging, testing, and meeting client requirements. This project helped me grow both technically and professionally, and it has inspired me to keep learning and taking on new challenges.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>

					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference. </p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>At Techsonix, my short-term goals are focused on building a strong foundation in both technical and professional skills. 
                    I aim to gain hands-on experience by contributing to real-time projects and improving my proficiency in the core technologies used by the team. </p>
                <p>    I also want to understand and adopt industry-standard practices such as version control, agile development, and effective documentation. 
                    In addition, I’m working on strengthening my communication and collaboration skills to become a productive team member. Ultimately, I hope to deliver meaningful contributions that positively impact the team and help me grow as a professional.</p>
